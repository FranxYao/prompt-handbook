# Prompt Handbook: Rules of Thumb for Writing Good Prompts

Some good enough rules when writing prompts. Let us explore the emergent abilities of large language models together!

Contributions and suggestions wellcome!! Add your experiences when writing prompts so we can be better witcher/ magician/ sorcerer/ alchemist, or scientist. 

Here we go: 

1. Use the largest model you have access to. GPT3 text-davinci-002 and code-davinci-002 are probably the best publically available models. 
2. code-davinci-002 is better at structured inputs and complex reasoning; text-davinci-002 is better at natural inputs and intuitive reasoning. 
3. Use the right number of examples. 1 example may be too few. 20 examples may be to many. 
4. For text-davinci-002, use natural language, use your human intuition to judge if one sentence is more natural than another. The more natural the language, the better  
5. For code-davinci-002, you can mix natural language with pseudo code. 
6. Use chain-of-thoughts prompts. 
   1. Be specific when writing chain of thoughts. 
   2. Be detailed when writing chain of thoughts, do not jump between steps, do not take shortcuts 
   3. Choose complex chain of thoughts, not simple chains, as your prompt
